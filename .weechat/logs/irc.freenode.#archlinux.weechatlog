2013-03-20 15:45:50	telmich	MrElendig: no - could not enable sshd so far, because systemd failed in arch-chroot
2013-03-20 15:45:50	_basic6	I thought <this> would look better. Anyway I won't use it anymore
2013-03-20 15:45:54	MrElendig	telmich: btw, don't hardboot, just C-A-F2 and C-A-D to reboot
2013-03-20 15:46:02	telmich	I'm still before the very first successful boot

2013-03-20 15:46:55	_basic6	So  by "like a boot screen" (what's currently on tty7) there are messages like [ok] started network time server and so on, basically what you see right before your login manager appears

2013-03-20 18:36:11	Apsu`	lydgate: If so, both the physical interface (if) and vif need to be in the bridge; DHCP on the bridge will snag one IP, and DHCP in the VM should grab another -- assuming that you can actually bridge across the physical if

2013-03-20 18:37:40	Apsu`	lydgate: Generally speaking, what you'd want to do instead is A) static IP on br0, B) dnsmasq/dhcpd serving on br0, C) dhcp on VM (vif in br0), D) ignore DHCP requests on eth0/wlan0/whatever
2013-03-20 18:37:55	webspid0r	Earnestly: they're using lossy formats exclusively

2013-03-20 19:59:39	ingandrea	Hi guys :) I recently installed Arch on my laptop that (unfortunatly) uses the "optimus tecnology", so I decided to install bumblebee...everything is working, or better ... everything was working :(
2013-03-20 19:59:39	ingandrea	A few days ago I updated my Arch Machine and I installed the new Kernel..3.8
2013-03-20 19:59:39	ingandrea	Well....now bumblebee doesn't work anymore!!
2013-03-20 19:59:39	ingandrea	When I try to launch optirun glxgears -info it gives me the following error:
2013-03-20 19:59:39	ingandrea	[ 2708.608653] [ERROR]You've no permission to communicate with the Bumblebee daemon. Try adding yourself to the 'bumblebee' group
2013-03-20 19:59:41	ingandrea	[ 2708.608739] [ERROR]Could not connect to bumblebee daemon - is it running?
2013-03-20 19:59:43	ingandrea	It seems the bumblebee daemon is inactive, but when I launch:
2013-03-20 19:59:45	ingandrea	systemctl start bumblebeed       no error is shown!
2013-03-20 19:59:47	ingandrea	I've already read the Wiki and everything I was able to find on the web, but nothing happened :(
2013-03-20 19:59:51	ingandrea	Can anyone please please please help me? Thx

2013-03-20 20:57:29	ingandrea	Hi guys :) I recently installed Arch on my laptop that (unfortunatly) uses the "optimus tecnology", so I decided to install bumblebee...everything is working, or better ... everything was working :(
2013-03-20 20:57:30	ingandrea	A few days ago I updated my Arch Machine and I installed the new Kernel..3.8
2013-03-20 20:57:30	ingandrea	Well....now bumblebee doesn't work anymore!!
2013-03-20 20:57:30	ingandrea	When I try to launch optirun glxgears -info it gives me the following error:
2013-03-20 20:57:30	ingandrea	[ 2708.608653] [ERROR]You've no permission to communicate with the Bumblebee daemon. Try adding yourself to the 'bumblebee' group

2013-03-20 20:57:34	ingandrea	It seems the bumblebee daemon is inactive, but when I launch:
2013-03-20 20:57:36	ingandrea	systemctl start bumblebeed       no error is shown!
2013-03-20 20:57:38	ingandrea	I've already read the Wiki and everything I was able to find on the web, but nothing happened :(
2013-03-20 20:57:40	ingandrea	Can anyone please please please help me? Thx
2013-03-20 20:57:42	grawity	Kingsy: Can you mount it manually?
